## Powered by
We are proud to collaborate with our client, Lagoon Cocktail Bar, who helped us in testing and refining the application. Their valuable input and feedback played a crucial role in the development of Smart Café, and we are grateful for their support.

The Smart Café team is also grateful to the University of Sarajevo and the Faculty of Electrical Engineering for providing us with the opportunity to work on this project and for equipping us with the knowledge and skills needed to create a functional and user-friendly web application.

Finally, we would like to acknowledge the power of open-source software and libraries, which we utilized throughout the project. Without these resources, Smart Cafe would not have been possible.

## Conclusion
The Smart Café is a convenient and easy-to-use application that makes ordering drinks in a cafe a breeze. The application is designed with the customer in mind, allowing for quick and easy modifications and cancellations of orders. We are excited to bring this innovative technology to cafes around the world.
